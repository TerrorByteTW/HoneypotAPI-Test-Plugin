# HoneypotAPI-Test-Plugin

A test plugin to demonstrate the features of the Honeypot API. [Check out Honeypot here!](https://github.com/TerrrorByte/Honeypot)

To use, run `/testcommand` in game to toggle cancelling player break and interact events.
You can also run `/checkblock` to see if it's a Honeypot or not.

If you want to demo Behavior Providers, create a Honeypot with the type of 'chicken-storm'. Warning -- turn down your volume ;)
